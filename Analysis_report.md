### Model Development and Evaluation

#### Initial Model
- **Architecture**:
  - First Hidden Layer: 80 neurons
  - Second Hidden Layer: 30 neurons
  - Output Layer: 1 neuron (sigmoid activation)
- **Performance**:
  - **Accuracy**: 72.79%
  - **Loss**: 0.5597

#### Optimized Model
- **Architecture**:
  - First Hidden Layer: 128 neurons
  - Second Hidden Layer: 64 neurons
  - Output Layer: 1 neuron (sigmoid activation)
- **Performance**:
  - **Accuracy**: 72.93%
  - **Loss**: 0.5709

#### Insights on Performance
The optimized model exhibited a minor improvement in accuracy (72.93% vs. 72.79%), yet the loss increased. This implies that added complexity did not yield significant performance gains.

### Steps Taken to Improve Model Performance
- Adjusted the number of neurons and layers.
- Experimented with varying numbers of epochs during training.
- Tested different batch sizes.

## Summary and Recommendations

### Summary
The neural network model captured some intricate relationships within the data but did not achieve the desired predictive performance levels.

### Recommendations
1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:  
   Experiment with learning rates, batch sizes, and regularization techniques (e.g., dropout layers) to mitigate overfitting and enhance generalization.

2. **Explore Alternative Models**:  
   Test models like XGBoost or Random Forest for better performance on structured data.

3. **Feature Engineering**:  
   Investigate opportunities to incorporate additional relevant features to improve model accuracy.

4. **Ensemble Methods**:  
   Utilize methods like Stacking or Voting Classifiers to combine multiple models for enhanced predictive accuracy.
