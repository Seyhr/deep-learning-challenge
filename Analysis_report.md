Comparison of Neural Network Architectures

First Model 
    First Hidden Layer: 80 neurons
    Second Hidden Layer: 30 neurons
    Output Layer: 1 neuron (sigmoid activation)
The performance of this model was:
    Accuracy: 72.79%
    Loss: 0.5597


Opitimze Model
    First Hidden Layer: Reduced to 128 neurons
    Second Hidden Layer: Increased to 64 neurons
    Output Layer: Remained unchanged at 1 neuron (sigmoid activation)
The updated model achieved:
    Accuracy: 72.93% 
    Loss: Reduced to 0.5709

Performance:
The optimized model saw a slight increase in accuracy (from 72.77% to 72.83%), but the loss actually increased (from 0.5627 to 0.6282), suggesting that while the model complexity was increased, it did not lead to significant improvements in overall performance.


Steps to Improve Performance:
    Adjusting the number of neurons and layers
    increased and decreased the number of epochos during training to allow more time to learn
    Tested different batch sizes for training

Summary
The deep learning model provided valuable insights but fell short of achieving the target performance for predictions. While the neural network approach was able to capture some of the complex relationships within the data, the overall accuracy and efficiency were not ideal.

Recommendation: Consider using alternative machine learning models, such as:
Recommendation:
Further Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with additional hyperparameter tuning, such as adjusting learning rates, batch sizes, and regularization techniques (e.g., dropout layers) to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.

Model Evaluation: Consider testing other models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest) as they may handle feature interactions more effectively and deliver better performance with structured data.

Additional Features: Investigate potential improvements in feature engineering or incorporating additional relevant features that might improve model accuracy.

Ensemble Methods: Explore ensemble approaches like Stacking or Voting Classifiers, which can combine multiple models to potentially achieve better predictive accuracy.
